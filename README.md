## Hey there!
- 🧑‍🍳 Kaulin is Finnish for a rolling pin. I own one but rarely use it.
- 🖥️ For C projects, check out our CLI [Minishell](https://github.com/kaulin/42_minishell) or raycasting game [Cub3D](https://github.com/em1e/cub3d)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ ([HTTP Server project](https://github.com/kaulin/42_webserv)), Docker, C# and the .NET ecosystem.
